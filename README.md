# Feza

onstructed a UAV with S1223 airfoil that adhered to the requirements of SAE, India. The UAV was launched manually
from a circular location, which necessitated a focus on controllability during the design process. Priority was given to weight
optimization for the payload and ensured structural strength, while simultaneously striving for innovation



Final_draft.pdf has the final desing report for our UAV. 



Will be uploading video of flight and xflr analysis files soon
